# tictactoe
Project 1 for GA-Boston WDI-30: Tic-Tac-Toe!

Currently allows play by 2 human players, and recognizes: 1) when a player has won, or 2) when there are no more moves.

TODO:
 For assignment completion:
  - create form for users to enter their names
  
 For personal enrichment:
  - enable computer opponent to play either X or O, employing:
    - random moves
    - random moves unless next move wins (decision tree to depth of 1)
    - full minimax implementation
  - arbitrary board size
